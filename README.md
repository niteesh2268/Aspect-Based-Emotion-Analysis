Project Description
----------------------
Aspect based emotion analysis aims to extract various aspects of reviews and determine the corresponding emotion for each aspect 
category .The term aspect refers to an attribute or a component of the product .Instead of classifyingthe emotion of overall review
into anger,sadness happiness, surprise and joy .Aspect-based analysis allows us to associate specific emotion to different aspects
of a product 

Example:<br />

Review : **The food was good but service was bad <br />**
Aspect list  : **{'food ','service'} <br />**
Aspect Emotion list : **{'food': 'Happy', 'service': 'Sad'} <br />**
